Added some of my coding examples for my job application
------
Some of my work on a CMS with PDF and job board integration for a headhunter agency, see <https://github.com/ChrisRuss/job_application/tree/master/jobboard>. See <http://jobapply-chris.herokuapp.com> for a "small" demo.

For some more examples and some test driven dev examples, see <https://github.com/ChrisRuss/job_application/tree/master/pre_register_project>, coded for a project in beta mode with sign up for a waiting list.

Also, I included some RSpec examples I have been co-working on for a subproject of the "pre register project", see <https://github.com/ChrisRuss/job_application/tree/master/rspec_examples/rspec>
