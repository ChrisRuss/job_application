Added some of my coding examples for my job application
------
See folder job board as example of a CMS with PDF and job board integration for a headhunter. See jobapply-chris.herokuapp.com for a "small" demo.
For some more examples and some test driven dev examples, see "pre_register_project" coded for a project in beta mode with sign up for a waiting list.
Also, I included some RSpec examples I have been co-working on for a subproject of the "pre register project", see rspec_examples
